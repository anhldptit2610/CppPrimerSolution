/*
    Exercise 7.18: What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?
*/

/* solution */

// Encapsulation is hiding implementation from the user. That means
// any data members or method which the user doesn't need to/aren't allowed to 
// access or modify is hided. By using private access specifier in a class, we
// achivement encapsulation.
